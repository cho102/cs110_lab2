BASIC REQUIREMENTS:
1.  Allow for two players to take turns. Assume X always starts the 
    game. 
2.  Detect when the game ends (when there is no more possible moves,
    i.e. all squares have either an X or an O). 
3.  Detect when a player wins. To win, the player must get three of 
    their pieces (X or O) in a row.
4.  Output message to indicate whether its player X's turn or player 
    O's turn. 
5.  Maintain the score for each player, i.e. the number of games 
    that player has won. There should be a "Reset" button that 
    resets the scores as well as the board. 
6.  Maintain an array that holds the squares that contain Xs and one 
    that holds the moves made by O. You can use this array to 
    determine if 9 moves have been made and whether its a tie, or 
    whether the current player who made the move just won the game. 
7.  Create a New Game button that resets the board and starts a new 
    game. Unlike the "Reset" button, the "New Game" button does not 
    reset the scores. 
8.  Your design should look similar to the above prototype but you 
    can be creative in your design as long the required elements 
    are included. Again be sure not to copy code online as that will 
    result in a zero.
9.  Once you implemented the above features, then create another 
    button to allow user to either "Play Against AI" or "Select 2 
    Players". If they select "Play Against AI" then create a simple 
    AI to allow the user to play against the computer. Note, the 
    computer can be pretty dumb and just select to play any random 
    square on the tic tac toe board.
10. Finally, you will add a time for players. Set the time to be 
    half a second (or some other reasonable time). You will need to 
    implement some sort of timer event 
    (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp (Links to an 
    external site.)). If a user is out of time, you should display 
    a message and then skip their turn. Ideally, your timer should 
    count down the seconds. This is an example on W3C that you can 
    modify and implement to countdown the seconds.
